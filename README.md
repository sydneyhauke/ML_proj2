# ML project 2 : Grokking - Reproducibility challenge

Welcome ! Before running the experiments, please perform the following operations :


```
python3 -m venv grok-venv
source grok-venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
ipython kernel install --user --name=grok-venv
jupyter notebook
``` 

There are 3 experiments located in their own respective Jupyter notebook : `grok.ipynb`, `Learning-curves-experiment-mod-11.ipynb` and `Optimizer-experiments.ipynb`.

Please run them with the virtual environment you created as the kernel in Jupyter.
